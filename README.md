lattice_normalization
=====================

This is an extension to the polymake system (http://polymake.org) for the computation of lattice normal forms of lattice polytopes and for checking lattice isomorphism of lattice polytopes (based on the algorithm of Kreuzer and Skarke (see http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0204356) with improvements by Grinis and Kasprzyk (http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.6641) 

This extension depends on the polymake extension polymake_flint_wrapper (http://github.com/apaffenholz/polymake_flint_wrapper), so please install and import this first.

To import this extension into polymake please download it and do 

import_extension("\<path_to_this_extension\>");

at the polymake prompt.
